# [Project 1: Game Behaviour Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/mvneema/Game_Behaviour_Analysis)
In this study, we aim to study whether it is possible to predict a specific game behavior in a Role Play Game, Fallout 3, based on playersâ€™ real world characteristics (e.g. personality trait scores, game expertise and gender information). Precise and correct prediction of in-game actions will, for example, help game designers provide more customized and dynamic contents to players.

# [Project 2: Insurance leverage customers](https://github.com/mvneema/Insurance-leverage-customers)
#### Context: 
Leveraging customer information is paramount for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, attributes of customers like (age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region,charges)can be crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to have.

# [Project 3: Personal loan](https://github.com/mvneema/Personal-loan-banking)
#### Context: 
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

# [Project 4: Deposit Subscription Classifier](https://github.com/mvneema/Ensemble-Techniques)
#### Objective:
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

#### Context:
Leveraging customer information is paramount for most businesses. In the case of a bank, attributes of customers like the ones mentioned below can be crucial in strategizing a marketing campaign when launching a new product.

# [Project 5: Concrete performance model tuner](https://github.com/mvneema/Feature-Enginering-Model-Tuning)
#### Context:
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. 
Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning techniques like hyperparameter tuning.

# [Project 6: Silhouette Classifier](https://github.com/mvneema/Principal-compenent-analysis)
#### Context:
The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles. Principle Component Analysis is used for this approach.
