# [Project 1: Game Behaviour Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/mvneema/Game_Behaviour_Analysis)
In this study, we aim to study whether it is possible to predict a specific game behavior in a Role Play Game, Fallout 3, based on playersâ€™ real world characteristics (e.g. personality trait scores, game expertise and gender information). Precise and correct prediction of in-game actions will, for example, help game designers provide more customized and dynamic contents to players.

#### Context: 
Leveraging customer information is paramount for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, attributes of customers like (age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region,charges)can be crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to have.
