# Project 1: Game Behaviour Analysis: Project Overview
In this study, we aim to study whether it is possible to predict a specific game behavior in a Role Play Game, Fallout 3, based on playersâ€™ real world characteristics (e.g. personality trait scores, game expertise and gender information). Precise and correct prediction of in-game actions will, for example, help game designers provide more customized and dynamic contents to players.
